vim-better-default
==================

There are some general settings for convenience in almost everyone's `.vimrc` file. Let's shorten your `.vimrc` and make the default vim better.

## Features

- **Out-of-the-box**: address a ton of deficiencies of the default vim configurations that nearly everyone can agree upon.

- **Mnemonic key bindings**: commands have mnemonic prefixes like `<Leader> b` for the buffer commands or `<Leader> w` for the window commands. `SPC` key is recommended as the leader key. You could also see the key bindings in [wiki](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default/wiki/a-brief-introduction-to-key-bindings).

If new to Vim, you can install [vim-better-default](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default) as a starting point, rather than copying some random vimrc you found.

If you have been a vimmer for quite a while, please see [default.vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default/blob/master/plugin/default.vim) directly. In the beginning [vim-better-default](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default) is intended for simplifying the tedious `.vimrc` file, so you may also use it to shorten your `.vimrc`.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed with a varity of plugin managers, such as:

- [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
    - Add `Plugin 'liuchengxu/vim-better-default` to .vimrc
    - Run `:source $MYVIMRC` and `:PluginInstall`
- [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
    - Add `Plug 'liuchengxu/vim-better-default` to .vimrc
    - Run `:source $MYVIMRC` and `:PlugInstall`

## Options

Option                                  | Description                        | Default |
:----                                   | :----                              | :----:
`vim_better_default_minimum`            | Only add essential funationalities | 0
`vim_better_default_backup_on`          | Set backup                         | 0
`vim_better_default_persistent_undo`    | Persistent undo                    | 0
`vim_better_default_enable_folding`     | Enable fold                        | 1
`vim_better_default_key_mapping`        | Whole key (re)mappings             | 1
`vim_better_default_basic_key_mapping`  | Basic key (re)mappings             | 1
`vim_better_default_buffer_key_mapping` | Buffer key mappings                | 1
`vim_better_default_file_key_mapping`   | File key mappings                  | 1
`vim_better_default_fold_key_mapping`   | Fold key mappings                  | 1
`vim_better_default_window_key_mapping` | Window key mappings                | 1


If you set the `vim_better_default_minumum` option, then vim seemingly looks like no difference with the default vim, it only adds some essential funtionalities.

```vim
let g:vim_better_default_minimum = 1
```

If you want to exclude key mappings in [vim-better-default](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default), just set the value as 0.

```vim
let g:vim_better_default_key_mapping = 0
```

For more details, please refer to the [default.vim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default/blob/master/plugin/default.vim). Don't worry. It is extremely simple and just part of your own `.vimrc` file alike.

You can also fork [vim-better-default](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-better-default) and modify `plugin/default.vim` for more customization.

## How to override the existing settings?

`default.vim` normally loads after your `.vimrc`, making it a bit tricky to override. If you want to load it earlier, add the following content to your `.vimrc`, then follow on the settings you want to override.

For instance, if you don't like relativenumber:

```vim
runtime! plugin/default.vim
set norelativenumber
```
